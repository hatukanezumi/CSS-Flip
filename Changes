+ lib/CSS/Yamaantaka.pm
+ lib/CSS/Yamaantaka/Consts.pm
  - Imp: Now CSS::Janus is a subclass of CSS::Yamaantaka for generalized
    transformation.
  - Imp: Supports cursors with four-letter positions (nwse-resize,
    nesw-resize).
  - Chg: renamed fixLeftAndRight() to fixBoxDirection() and
    fixLeftAndRightInUrl() to fixBoxDirectionInUrl().
  - Chg: renamed 'swap_left_right_in_url' option to 'flip_url' because
    it triggers not only simple mirroring.
  - Imp: New option 'flip_cursor' with default value 1.
  - Imp: fixBoxDirection() is applied to "line-relative" properties
    (text-align, float, clear and vertical-align) only when true mirroring
    (ltr <=> rtl) occurs.
  - Imp: Properties including "right"/"left" proposed to be dropped
    won't flip: ruby-position: right & ruby-align: left/right by IE.
+ t/16bisCursor.t
  - Added four-letter cases.
+ t/22terSingleBorderRadius.t
  - Added cases of border-radius with single direction.
# tests under t/ expanded to non-horizontal cases are not listed above.
